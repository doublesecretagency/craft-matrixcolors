# Matrix Colors plugin for Craft CMS

**Identify your Matrix blocks by giving each type a different color.**

---

- _**NEW:** Added support for Neo block types!_

---

## How to Install

See official installation instructions on the [Craft CMS Plugin Store...](https://plugins.craftcms.com/matrix-colors)

## Managing Block Colors

Once the plugin is installed, manage the colors of your Matrix block types (or Neo block types) by going to:

<p align="center">
    <strong>Settings > Plugins > Matrix Colors</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img width="401" alt="Screenshot of navigating to the plugin's settings page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doublesecretagency/craft-matrixcolors/467645a603a313901652d82a1aff6dc3c770deb7/src/resources/img/settings.png">
</p>

## Basic Usage

To set the background color of a Matrix (or Neo) block type, enter the **block type handle** and desired **CSS color**.

</p>

Here's what that looks like in a Matrix field...

</p>

Repeat for every block type which you'd like to assign a color to.

You can use any colors you want, but pastels (lighter colors) tend to look better.

## Shared Colors for Multiple Block Types

You can easily specify the same color for multiple block types. Either give each block type its own row, or list them all together using commas to separate each block type handle.

</p>

## Neo Support

If you are also using the [Neo](https://plugins.craftcms.com/neo) plugin, you can similarly color your Neo blocks.

Simply declare your Neo block type handles alongside their assigned colors, just as you would with Matrix block type handles.
